# Django 2 By Example Projects

My projects based on the Django2 By Example book by Nobert Mate. All code has been written line by line to help me learn and understand Django 2 concepts.

## Projects
### Blog
This initial project covers basics of Django: view, models, forms, template tags & filters (in addition to custom ones), site maps, syndication feeds, full text search (using PostgreSQL search capabilites). This project can be found in the `brians_bytes` folder. The project covers the first 3 chapters of the book.
